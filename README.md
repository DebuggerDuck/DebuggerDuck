## Summary ##
 Our app saves time and reduces stress for all members on your team, while building a sense of community. By logging in with Facebook, you can volunteer to get food for your friends, or ask a friend to get food for you.


## Problem ##
	Have you ever spent lunch alone when you didn’t know anyone yet? Do you wish Kevin would ask you if you wanted a burrito before he went to Chipotle? Did your lightning talk cost you your lunch break? Did you feel that the rubber duck debugger made you work on your sprint through lunch, so you were stuck eating animal crackers instead of a nice burger from P.Terry’s? 


## Solution ##


With our app, food is only one click away. If you are going to get food, our app lets you announce your services to others and maximize your team’s productivity. Your friends can request food items, and you can gain karma points for bringing them food back. When you need to be outside, you walk and get food.  When you’re busy, you can let our app do the coordination for you.
